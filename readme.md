# SPINEN's Laravel Mail Assertions

NOTE: This is based off a video titled ["Testing Email With Custom Assertions"](https://laracasts.com/series/phpunit-testing-in-laravel/episodes/12) that [Jeffrey Way](https://github.com/JeffreyWay) did on [Laracasts.com](https://laracasts.com).  If you do not have an account on that site, then you should make one.  It is an amazing resource.  We have just taken that example & made it an easy-to-install package.  Thanks Jeffrey!

## Installation

Install the package:

```bash
$ composer require spinen/laravel-mail-assertions --dev
```

## Configuration

In order for the package to be able to make assertions on your emails, it has to be able to "read" the messages. It does so by parsing the Laravel log, so your mail driver has to be "log" for this package to function.

## Usage

You mixin the assertions with the ```Spinen\MailAssertions\MailTracking``` trait.  You get the following assertions...

* seeEmailBcc
* seeEmailCc
* seeEmailContains
* seeEmailContentTypeEquals
* seeEmailCountEquals
* seeEmailDoesNotContain
* seeEmailEquals
* seeEmailFrom
* seeEmailPriorityEquals
* seeEmailReplyTo
* seeEmailSubjectContains
* seeEmailSubjectDoesNotContain
* seeEmailSubjectEquals
* seeEmailTo
* seeEmailWasNotSent
* seeEmailWasSent

NOTE: If there was more than 1 email sent, then the assertions look at the last email.

## Example

```php
<?php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\WithoutMiddleware;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\DatabaseMigrations;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\DatabaseTransactions;
use Spinen\MailAssertions\MailTracking;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    use MailTracking;

    /**
     * A basic functional test example.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function testBasicExample()
    {
        $this->visit('/route-that-sends-an-email')
             ->seeEmailWasSent()
             ->seeEmailSubject('Hello World')
             ->seeEmailTo('foo@bar.com')
             ->seeEmailEquals('Click here to buy this jewelry.')
             ->seeEmailContains('Click here');
    }
}
```
